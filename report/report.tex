\title{Static analysis for the PHP language}
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  This report presents the work that was done to implement a static analysis
  tool for the PHP programming language. This tool aims at providing feedback
  to a developer by checking for multiple mis-uses of the language and should
  reduce the risk of encountering fatal errors at runtime after deployement of
  PHP based application.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
The PHP programming language is a compiled language. However, the compilation is
done, by default, each time a certain php file is requested. This means that the
compilation has to be fast and hence can't do much analysis and checks. Most of
the checks are thus made at runtime. This project aims at providing a static
analysis tool able to catch some programming errors that PHP would only report
at runtime. Despite the fact that PHP is one of the most used programming language
used to develop web applications, the ammount of work being put on static analysis
is very limited. At this day, I'm only aware of one other tool providing static
analysis for PHP, written in C++. However, the primary goal of such tool is
not directly to provide feedback to developers.

\section{Design}
This tool consists of a custom PHP compiler, translating the code
into structures such as Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and then Control Flow Graphs
(CFG) which are needed in order to analyse aspects of the code. This compiler is
divided into five distinct parts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Lexing
  \item Parsing and Abstract Syntax Trees
  \item Semantic Analysis
  \item Crontrol Flow Graphs
  \item Helpers
\end{enumerate}

Some sections were implemented in Java, since the tool used requires it, but the
main part of the compiler is written in Scala.

\subsection{Lexing}
The lexer uses a modified version of JFlex\footnote{JFlex: http://jflex.de}. The
original PHP compiler uses flex as scanner. The modification done to JFlex is
the implementation of flex's \verb=yymore()=, which currently lacks in JFlex.
This function is used to tell the scanner that the following rules should be
appended to \verb=yytext= instead of overwriting it. The JFlex syntax file is an
adapted version of the original flex file. This step was done in Java.

\subsection{Parsing and Abstract Syntax Trees}
The parser, as mentionned before, is based on a modified version of CUP. CUP is
a java based parser generator which uses a syntax similar to yacc, the parser
generator used in the original PHP compiler. The version of CUP used for this
project differs from the original one in two points:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The original CUP cannot handle large syntax files. Indeed, since CUP
    directly writes the parsing tables as properties of the generated class,
    the size of the class properties can become too large for \emph{javacc}. The
    PHP grammar being quite big, the resulting parser class couldn't be compiled.
    To solve the problem, CUP was modified to provide an option specifying that the
    the multiple tables should be written into files and loaded at runtime. This
    modification was proposed to be included inside CUP.
  \item To avoid the troubles of referencing scala classes, the parser
    generator was modified to translate the application of the production into a
    simple tree which could then be translated by a Scala class entirely.
\end{enumerate}

The Syntax Tree (ST) is then translated into an AST. This is done by visiting
the tree and decomposing syntax elements:

\begin{listing}
\begin{verbatim}
    // ...
    def extends_from(n: ParseNode): Option[StaticClassRef] = {
        childrenNames(n) match {
            case List() =>
                None
            case List("T_EXTENDS", "fully_qualified_class_name") =>
                Some(fully_qualified_class_name(child(n, 1)))
        }
    }
    // ...
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{parser/STToAST.scala: Example of ST to AST decomposition}
\end{listing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb=chidldrenNames(node)= is used to return a list of strings,
    representing the tokens or productions.
  \item \verb=child(node, index)= is used to access the N'th child
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Semantic Analysis}
Some checks can be done direcly by looking at the AST. Indeed, PHP provides a
wide range of features, some of them being considered nowadays as bad practice.
This tool emits notices for the following issues:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Non top-level declaration: PHP allows a developer to conditionnaly
    declare functions or classes. This not only generates problems with the
    following analysis, but also induces some performance hits on servers equipied
    with so-called opcode cachers. Those opcode cachers are responsible for caching
    the intermediate--or compiled version of each file, function and class. The
    goal being to speed up the process by reducing the number of compilations
    required per request. This cannot be done easily if those declarations are
    conditional.
  \item Call-time pass-by-ref: a function accepting a reference\footnote{PHP
    References: https://php.net/references} has to be defined as such, but PHP
    allows the developer to pass a reference at the time of the call, even to a
    function not declared to receive one. This feature is deprecated, and can cause
    unwanted side-effects.
  \item Non-trivial include calls: the \verb=include=\footnote{PHP Include:
    http://php.net/include} statement allows a developer to execute the given file
    in the current scope. The argument representing the file to include can be
    dynamic. This tool will try to resolve dynamic expressions that are most
    commonly used to be able to extend the analysis to that file. In case the
    expression is too dynamic, that include call will be ignored. Any
    combination of those expressions are considered as trivial dynamic expressions
    for include calls:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item the concatenation operator: "."
      \item the \verb=dirname()=\footnote{PHP dirname: http://php.net/dirname} function,
          used to retrieve the parent directory of the path passed as argument
      \item constants
      \item class constants
      \item string
    \end{itemize}
  \item Dynamic object properties: PHP allows dynamic references to an object property
    using a variable or expression (e.g. \verb.$name = "a"; $obj->$name. instead of
    \verb.$obj->a.). This is usually considered as bad practice since arrays are
    usually prefered for such tasks.
  \item Dynamic variables: PHP allows to reference a variable using either a
    variable, or an expression\footnote{PHP Variable variables:
    http://php.net/variables.variable}: (\verb=$$var= or
    \verb=${'prefix'.$name.foo()}=).
\end{itemize}

Another part of the semantic analysis consists of validating the usage of
identifiers such as variables, functions or classes. The goal is to ensure that
no obvious semantic errors such as inheritance cycles, or visibility
inconsistances exist.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{verbatim}
<?php
class A extends D { } 
class B extends A { }
class C extends A { }
?>
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{Class inheritance cycle}
\end{listing}

\begin{listing}
  \begin{verbatim}
test.php:2  Error: Classes A -> B -> C form an inheritance cycle
class A extends B {}
^
test.php:4  Error: Class C extends non-existent class A
class C extends A {}
                ^
2 errors occured, abort
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{Cycle detection error}
\end{listing}

\begin{listing}
  \begin{verbatim}
<?php
class A {
    public function test() {}
}

class B extends A {
    protected function test() {}
}
?>
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{Visibility inconsistance}
\end{listing}

\begin{listing}
  \begin{verbatim}
test.php:7  Error: Method B::test cannot overwrite A::test 
                   with visibility protected (was public)
    protected function test() {}
                       ^
1 error occured, abort
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{Visibility error}
\end{listing}

Since PHP allows a developer to dynamically create and reference variables, it
is close to impossible to detect undeclared or unused variables solely based on
symbols collection. PHP is also loosely typed, which means type propagations
and checks cannot sanely be done using the AST only. In fact, the AST is only the
intermediate step that only let us do trivial checks. To analyse more complex
aspects of a program, this tool will use control flow graphs (CFG) which are
derived from ASTs.

\subsection{Control flow graphs}
Control flow graphs modelize the flow of values through the different control
structures. It will be used here to detect unreachable branches of code, and to
propagate types. Some basic type checks can be done, but since PHP does
automatic type juggling, only few type errors resulting in fatal errors can
occur. However this tool can be set to be verbose and emit notices for each
type juggling, giving the chance to catch un-wanted type-juggling side effects.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{verbatim}
<?php
function test() {
  $a = 0;
  for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $a += $i;
  }
}
?>
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{Control structure example}
  \label{cfg1}
\end{listing}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{CFG1.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Control flow graph for Listing~\ref{cfg1}}
\end{figure}

\begin{listing}
  \begin{verbatim}
<?php
function test() {
  $a = 0;
  for($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    break;
    $a += $i;
  }
}
?>
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{Control structure with unreachable code}
  \label{cfg2}
\end{listing}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{CFG2.jpg}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Control flow graph for Listing~\ref{cfg2}, showing unreachable branches}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Helpers}
In order to check that parts of the tool was working as expected, some helpers were
developped to retrieve information about each steps. The main helpers are able to generate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A list of tokens generated from the file
  \item A dot file representing the Syntax Tree graph
  \item A dot file representing the Abstract Syntax Tree
  \item A dot file representing the Control Flow Graph, highlighting control structures
    such as \verb=if=, \verb=for=, \verb=foreach=, \verb=while=, \verb=dowhile=
\end{itemize}

Those helpers were used to generate the figures presented in this report.

\section{Limitations and future work}
As the timespan of this project was only one semester, only some limited
analysis has been done, and some shortcuts were taken.  For example, PHP
references were ignored as they add much more complexity to the process, while
their usage is limited. Additionally, even though the code base for the syntax
is PHP 5.3, some of its features such as namespaces or closures has been left
out. The aim of this project being to provide something useful, some implementation
details were ignored, which means that the current codebase contains several
\emph{TODO} annotation, that would have to be looked over whenever some
additional time on this project.

Much more analysis could be done, such as value ranges analysis, that can help
guide the traversal of the CFG to gain precision. Also, the model used for
arrays could be precised to allow more fine-grained analysis.

\section{Conclusions}
This project was really interessant because it was based on a real language, used
every day by millions of users wolrdwide. Such a tool, once reaching stability
and soundness to some extent can make a considerable impact. However, due to the
number of lacks in the current implementation, the tool as-is wouldn't be of
much help in most cases. I hope that I'll find more time to work on it, either
on my free time or as a school-related project, because I feel that there is a
real gap to fill regarding static analysis of PHP related programs and scripts.
